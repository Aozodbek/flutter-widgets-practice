# Flutter Widgets Practice: Stateless and Stateful Widgets

A new Flutter project created with FlutLab - https://flutlab.io

# The WidgetsPractice project includes the following features:

# Greeting Widget: 
A stateless widget that displays a greeting message. The message can be customized by passing it as a parameter to the widget.

# Counter Widget: 
A stateful widget that displays a counter. The counter starts at 0 and increments each time a button is pressed.
Widget Tree: A widget tree that demonstrates the nesting of stateless and stateful widgets. The tree is designed to be at least 3 levels deep.

# Widget Styling: 
Different styles are applied to the widgets, including custom colors, gradients, padding, and font styles. This helps create an appealing and visually engaging UI.
